The Output Alignment Protocol (OAP)Standardizing LLM Output Fidelity Through Source Data AnnotationWelcome to the official GitLab repository for the Output Alignment Protocol (OAP).
OAP is an open standard designed to address the critical challenge of ensuring consistent, predictable, and reliably formatted outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) when 
processing diverse source data. As LLMs are increasingly integrated into complex data pipelines, RAG systems, and automated workflows, maintaining high fidelity between source 
data intent and generated output format is paramount. OAP provides a simple, tag-based annotation method that data providers can embed directly into source content, offering 
explicit directives that OAP-compliant LLMs prioritize during output generation.By adopting OAP, developers, data curators, and LLM providers can achieve:Enhanced Output 
Predictability: Reduce variability in LLM response formatting.Improved Data-to-Output Fidelity: Ensure source data constraints and priorities are respected.Simplified 
Integration: Streamline the development of applications consuming LLM outputs.Increased Interoperability: Foster a common language between data and LLMs across different 
platforms.Getting StartedThe core of OAP v1.1 is the <OAP_format> tag. Data providers embed instructions within these tags in their source content. OAP-compliant LLMs are 
designed to identify and strictly adhere to these instructions when generating output based on that content.Basic Example:

ingestion and output generation pipelines to recognize and prioritize instructions within <OAP_format> tags.For LLM Developers: Consult the OAP v1.1 Specification for
 guidelines on building OAP-compliant models.For Application Developers: When preparing source data for OAP-compliant LLMs, embed your desired output directives using 
the <OAP_format> tag as specified.(Note: This repository serves as the primary documentation and resource hub for the OAP standard.)ContributingOAP is an open standard.
